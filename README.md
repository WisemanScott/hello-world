# hello-world
This is my first Repo for Umuzi 2021

I am an individual with unique and natural leadership qualities that I often use not only to advance my life but to better the lives of others
around me, and empathetic enough to contribute to any organization. I am the type of a person who is ambitious, energetic, hard-working
and consistent in setting firm goals and making sure that necessary actions are taken to accomplish them.
